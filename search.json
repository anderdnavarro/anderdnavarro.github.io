My research has focused on uncovering the mechanisms of non-coding mutations in cancer (especially hematological neoplasias) and on developing machine learning tools for detecting and benchmarking somatic mutations in whole-genome and exome sequencing data. After returning from my postdoc in Toronto, I'm now based in Asturias, Spain, and looking to collaborate with people and organizations who are as passionate about research as I am. When I'm not debugging, you'll probably find me outdoors, running, bouldering, or getting lost in a good science fiction book.\n              \n          \n      \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nCareer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosition\nInstitution\nYears\n\n\n\n\nPostdoctoral Fellow  Ontario Genomics & CANSSI Ontario fellowship\nUniversity of Toronto (Canada)  Ontario Institute for Cancer Research (OICR)\n2023–2025\n\n\nResearch Assistant\nUniversity of Oviedo (Spain)\n2022–2023\n\n\nPhD in Biomedicine and Molecular Oncology  Cum laude, international PhD and extraordinary doctorate awards  Basque Government FPI fellowship\nUniversity of Oviedo (Spain)\n2017–2022\n\n\nVisiting researcher (during PhD)  EMBO Scientific Exchange Grant\nUniversity of Oulu (Finland)\n09/2021-11/2021\n\n\nMSc in Biomedicine and Molecular Oncology  Basque Government and BBK scholarships\nUniversity of Oviedo (Spain)\n2016–2017\n\n\nBSc in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology  Basque Government scholarship\nUniversity of the Basque Country (Spain)\n2012–2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, I co-founded, together with a group of friends, the non-profit organization “Grupo de R de Asturias” (Asturias R Group), where I currently serve as Secretary. This association promotes the use of R through training courses and scientific visualization competitions for students, teachers, and researchers, in collaboration with other research centers such as the “Fundación para la Investigación y la Innovación Biosanitaria de Asturias” (FINBA).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelected publications\n* Indicates equal contribution | # Indicates corresponding author\n\nDíaz-Navarro,A.#, Zhang,X., Jiao,W., Wang,B. and Stein,L#.
